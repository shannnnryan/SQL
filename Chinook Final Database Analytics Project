##For this project I downloaded a database Chinook that had several tables of information. 
##I used this data to query the following information.

#1--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE COUNTRY <> "USA";

#2--Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = "Brazil";

#3--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, 
cust.LastName, 
inv.InvoiceId, 
inv.InvoiceDate,
inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers AS cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE cust.Country = "Brazil";

#4--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE "%sales%agent%";

#5--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT cust.LastName AS customer_name, emp.LstName AS sales_agent, inv.invoiceid, inv.total, cust.country
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees emp ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid
ORDER BY inv.invoiceid ASC;

#8--How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) as Total_invoices
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9--What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


#10--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT track.name, invit.InvoiceLineID
FROM chinook.tracks track
JOIN chinook.invoice_items invit ON track.trackid = invit.trackid;

#11--Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT
trac.name,art.name, item.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.artists art
JOIN chinook.albums alb ON art.artistid = alb.artistid
JOIN chinook.tracks trac ON alb.albumid = trac.albumid
JOIN chinook.invoice_items item ON trac.trackid = item.invoiceid;

#12--Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name AS "track_name", al.title AS "album_title", m.name AS "media_type", g.name AS genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums al
ON t.albumid = al.albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON t.mediatypeid = m.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid;

#13--Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.Title, ROUND (SUM(inv.total), 2) AS 'Total_Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e

JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON c.customerid = inv.customerid

WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

#14----Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?


SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.Title, ROUND (SUM(inv.total), 2) AS 'Total_Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e

JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON c.customerid = inv.customerid

WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
