# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--Who were the top 3 most popular artist of 2021?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 3;

--Who was the loudest artist of 2021?
SELECT artist_name, loudness
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness ASC
LIMIT 1;

--What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM spotifydata;

--Which songkey had the most danceability?
SELECT danceability, song_key
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC, song_key;

--What is the average danceability and populatiry by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability), AVG(popularity)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
  SELECT
  artist_name, AVG(popularity) as Avg_pop
  FROM spotifydata
  GROUP BY artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, Avg_pop, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE Avg_pop>=90;
